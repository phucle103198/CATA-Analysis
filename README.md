# CATA-Analysis

This project includes code snippets to analyze CATA tests for products. The tasks performed include separating terms from text data collected by the googleform platform. Then frequency statistics and Q Corchan tests are applied to determine the significance level of the attributes. The product's overall liking score is used to calculate the penalty lift for the presence or absence of that attribute. Finally, the Penalty + Percent of users chart serves as a suggestion to help formula adjusters know in which direction to improve
